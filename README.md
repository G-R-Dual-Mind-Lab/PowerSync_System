# CPS_PowerSync_System
 This project proposes an optimized power delivery solution for EV charging stations using leader election and distributed computing algorithms. By applying cyber-physical systems (CPS) concepts, it enhances charging infrastructure efficiency, supporting sustainable and intelligent energy management.
 
The project has been implemented in MATLAB Simulink, utilising the SimEvents, Stateflow and Simulink Test libraries.

# Previews
###### Graph showing how the charging points come to a consensus in relation to vehicle power requirements. The functions depicted with continuous lines represent the average value estimates calculated through the Push-Sum modules. The dotted lines represent the power requests. The colours serve to distinguish the different nodes (charging points) in the network.

###### Graph showing the value of the SoC of the vehicle connected to CP1 (function represented by the darker colour) in relation to the average value estimate calculated via the Push-Sum module of charging point 1 (function represented by the lighter colour).
